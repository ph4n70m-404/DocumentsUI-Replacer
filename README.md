# DocumentsUI-Replacer
**Stock is not fully supported because documentsui is supposed to be updated by project mainline aka google play system updates meaning it can cause weird bugs.**

Magisk module that replaces the DocumentsUI package with the AICP one.

DocumentsUI is the built in file manager that depending on the rom is also the only file manager.
The main reason to use this module is it will fix DocumentsUI packages that can't see inside zip files or any other bugs. Another benefit is that it will be added to the homescreen as files if the rom doesn't already have the DocumentsUI package as the file manager on the homescreen e.g. roms like Evolution X that have the google file manager instead.
